# Astronomy ML Project

This repository provides a template for an end-to-end Machine Learning and Deep Learning project in the astronomy field. It uses TensorFlow, Keras, MLflow, and Prefect. Docker is used for containerization, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is used for data storage (BigQuery) and computing (GCE).

## Features

- **Data Pipelines**: Data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation
- **Modeling**: TensorFlow and Keras models
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow for tracking and model registry
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Prefect for scheduling and automation
- **Containerization**: Docker for local and production setups
- **Cloud Deployment**: Scripts for running on GCP (BigQuery, Compute Engine)
- **Tests**: Unit and integration tests
- **CI/CD**: (Optional) You can integrate GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployments.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astronomy-ml-project.git
cd astronomy-ml-project
